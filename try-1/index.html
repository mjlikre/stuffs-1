            <h1>A Little Something About Me</h1>
            <p>I was born in China and moved to Nicaragua when i was 10, and live there until I came to U.S. for college. I've grown quite font of my adopted country, if you ask me where I'm from, I would say that I'm from Nicaragua. </p>
            <p>I'm currently a sophmore in college, studying finance at Hult International Business School in San Francisco. I decided to join this bootcamp because I'm really interested in web development and would like to find a job in this area, plus a job in the tech industry pays the bills.</p>
            <p>I hope to get the most out of this bootcamp and use the portfolio that I build to find an internship next summer. Wish me luck! </p>
